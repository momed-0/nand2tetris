# Project 1: [Implementation of Elementary Logic Gates](https://github.com/momed-0/nand2tetris/tree/main/Project%201)

This project aims at building 15 elementary logic gates using a Hardware Description Language (HDL) in turn yielding a basic chip-set.
The 15 logic gates are
1) Xor
2) Or
3) And
4) And16
5) Or16
6) Or8Way
7) Not
8) Not16
9) Mux
10) Mux16
11) Mux4Way16
12) Mux8Way16
13) DMux
14) DMux4Way
15) DMux8Way

NAND gate was the universal logic gate which is used to develop all these elementary logic gates.
